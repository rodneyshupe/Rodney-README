# Rodney.README

This is a new document and still a work in progress. It’s meant to be documentation on me.

I'm looking forward to getting to know you! This document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work.

## Who Am I

I am based out of Vancouver, BC Canada and love to live in the downtown core.
<img src="/img/banner_vancouver.jpg" alt="Vancouver" width="600px">

At Home I am a husband and father. I love to cook and am a bit of a Science Fiction and Sports nut. I only write code for personal projects and tools to help me accomplish tasks and make my life easier or more fun.

At Work I am a leader, and although I don't write much code any more I have led multi-national software development teams for over 20 years.

## My Availability

TLDR; Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. If you need to talk, let’s talk.

Heard a rumour? Need clarification on something? Blocked? I’d love to hear as soon as possible. Shoot me a Slack message, hop on a quick Teams Chat, we don’t need to wait for our next scheduled 1:1.

Feel free to put something in my calendar, don’t feel like you need to ask first.
Is my calendar full? Send me a message and I’ll very likely be able to move something around.

I work a bit on the weekends/after hours. This is my choice. I do not expect you to work on the weekend / after hours. I might Slack you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until the next work day.

I take vacations. You should, too. You will do your best work when you are refreshed.

## My Assumptions

You’re very good at your job. You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. If it feels like I’m questioning you it’s because I’m either: a) Trying to gather context. Or b) Trying to be a sounding board and rubber duck.

I’m not good at your job. You know best. I’ll work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you vet your ideas but I won’t override you.

You’ll let me know if you can’t do your job. One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you’re set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won’t know I’m letting you down.

You feel safe debating with me. I find that ideas improve by being examined from all angles. If it sounds like I’m disagreeing I’m most likely just playing devil’s advocate. This does rely on us being able to have a safe debate.

## North Star Principles

**People first.** I believe that happy, informed, and productive people build a fantastic product. I optimize for the people. Other leaders will maximize the business, the technology, or any different number of important facets. Ideological diversity is key to an effective team. All perspectives are relevant, and we need all these leaders, but my bias is towards building productive humans.

**Leadership comes from everywhere.** While managers are an essential part of a scaling organization, I don’t believe they have a monopoly on Leadership. I work hard to build other constructs and opportunities for any person on the team to be a leader.

**I see things as systems.** I reduce all complex things into systems. I think in flowcharts. I take great joy in attempting to understand how these systems and flowcharts all fit and work together. When I see large or small inefficiencies in these complex systems, I’d like to fix them with your help.

**It is important to me that people are treated fairly.** I believe that most people are trying to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity. I believe those in power have a disproportionate responsibility to proactively invest in people who have historically been disadvantaged.

**I am heavily biased towards action.** Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate.

**I default to delegation.** I believe the delegation of increasingly large, complex, and high-risk projects to my team is the correct way to build trust and grow the team. If you feel a thing I’ve delegated to you is too large, complex, or risky, you should tell me, and I will help. You should know that I would not make this delegation choice if I did not believe you would be successful.

**I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things.** I believe quality assurance is everyone’s responsibility, and there are bugs to be fixed everywhere… all the time.

**I start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved.** This has worked out well for me over my career.


## How can I help you?

Please let me know how else I can help. 

**Provide context.** Most of my day is spent collecting, filtering and sharing context/information from across other projects, domains, and product lines. I’ll try to push information to you as much as I can but feel free to ask about anything else.

**Provide an outside(ish) perspective.** I won’t be working on your project day to day but will be close enough to have informed thoughts.

**Cheer.** I will celebrate your successes. If you're not a person who self-promotes, please let me do it for you. Tell me when things go well, share the things which make you proud, and I'll cheer/share appropriately.

**Firefight.** One of my favourite opening lines is "I could use a hand with...", my second favourite is "I screwed up: ...". A mistake, if shared, becomes a challenge; if hidden, becomes a failure.

## How can you help me?

**Do amazing work.** This is the expectation. Let me know if there is something preventing you from accomplishing this.

**Disagree with me.** The best solutions comes from a healthy level of debate. We need to be able to separate our ideas from our egos . I’ll challenge your ideas with the goal of coming to the best possible solution, I hope you’ll challenge mine.

**Tell me when I screw up.** This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don’t notice. I need to know or I’ll likely do it again.

**Communicate.** One of my jobs is to provide context. Are you missing some? Let me know and I’ll fill you in or go find out.

**Bring your friends.** We’re growing the team and you know who you want to work with.

## Your development

Your career is yours. You know best how you’d like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective.

I’ll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it’ll be up to you to seize them. Let’s work together on this.

At the end of the day, it is your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. Let me know how I can help you achieve them.

## Feedback

### Feedback for You

I don’t believe in storing feedback and then scheduling a time to provide it. If I have feedback to give you I’ll work to provide it as soon as possible, in the moment if I can. It’s unlikely it’ll start with “I have some feedback to give you”.

I will give you feedback on how you're doing continuously, including in our 1:1s. If I'm worried about your performance, I will let you know. My goal is for you to never be unsure about how you're performing (and how I think you're performing). If you ever feel unsure about either of these things, please let me know.

If you’d like specific feedback on something let me know! I’m happy to provide an outside perspective.

What should you do with feedback?  Consider it. Acting on it is not required. You’ll receive a lot of feedback. Most of it will be good, some of it won’t be. Like everything else, please think about each piece critically and decide whether to act on it or not.

### Feedback for Me

If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories. Even if you think it might not be the case, I _do_ want to hear it. And if you think I don't want to hear it, I'd love to hear why you feel that way.

If you can give me this feedback face-to-face (Teams or in person), that's my preference. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all.

If you're not comfortable giving me some feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me.

Similarly, if you have feedback for a team member or colleague, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, let's chat and I can either get the feedback to them or we can figure out a way to deliver it that makes you comfortable.

## 1:1s

There’s a lot of variety in frequency, length and format of one on ones with my direct reports. From thirty minutes bi-weekly to an hour per week. Coffee in the cafe, private meeting room, head out for a walk, let me know what works best.

Length, frequency, format and content is up to you. We’ll start with 30 minutes bi-weekly and then adjust from there.

The best 1:1s I’ve had have focused beyond the moment: Your career development, team strategy and opportunity, etc. Feel free to come with a topic you’d like to discuss. I’d love it if you spent a few minutes beforehand preparing so that we can get the most of our time.

One way to do this is we can create a private Slack channel for us to track 1:1 topics, action items and decisions. You can use this to write down some things throughout the week that you want to chat about if you think that will help, since it can sometimes be hard to think of or bring up things in the moment.

## My interests
Here are some things I love. If you ever want to strike up casual conversation and don't know what to talk about, these are good bets :smiley:

* **Cooking and baking.** I love trying new recipes and new cooking techniques. I always want to hear about new recipes you've tried or want to try, or just chat about cooking and baking in general.  I have collected a bunch of recipes in a book ([Recipes from the Messy Chef](https://github.com/rodneyshupe/Cookbook)) that is built and hosted on guthub.  If you like cocktails I also have a book ([Libations](https://github.com/rodneyshupe/Libations)) on those too.

* **Electronics Projects** I enjoy working with various SOCs, specific Raspberry Pis and Arduino based systems.  I have built numerous projects using these types of systems.

* **Sports** I am a huge Sports fan.  I am a season ticket holder for both the BC Lions and Whitecaps and travel to the Grey Cup most years and actually got to party with i the trophy for a night.  I usually do at least one BC Lions road trip each year.

## TODO

This document is still a wip. I’d love your feedback.
- Did you find the time you spent reading this valuable?
- Was something critical missing?
- Were there sections included that you didn’t find useful

If you see me not living up to anything included please let me know. It’s possible that I’ve changed my mind (👍). More likely I’m dropping the ball (👎). Either way I’d like to know.
